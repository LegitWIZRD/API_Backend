This is the beginnings of a backend api. The docker file is setup to run a container with an endpoint of "127.0.0.1:9999" on the local machine and has 3 endpoints:

"127.0.0.1:9999"

"127.0.0.1:9999/ok"

"127.0.0.1:9999/rickandmorty"

Reaching the endpoint will return a message, but will later have CRUD functionality built into a frontend GUI/Web application. 

Credit to @curiousrohan for his work on the rick and morty API where some of the returned data came from.
